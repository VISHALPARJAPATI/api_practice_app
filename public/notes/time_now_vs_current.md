In Ruby on Rails, both `Time.current` and `Time.now` are used to get the current date and time, but they have subtle differences in terms of time zone handling.

1. `Time.now`:
   `Time.now` returns the current date and time in the system's local time zone. This means that the returned time will depend on the time zone setting of the machine/server running the Rails application.

   ```ruby
   current_time = Time.now
   ```

2. `Time.current`:
   `Time.current` is a Rails-specific method provided by ActiveSupport that returns the current date and time in the application's configured time zone, which is typically set in the `config/application.rb` file.

   ```ruby
   current_time = Time.current
   ```

The crucial difference between the two lies in time zone handling. `Time.current` ensures that the time returned is adjusted according to the application's time zone, providing consistent time values across different environments regardless of the system's time zone settings. This is especially important in Rails applications because you want consistent behavior regardless of where the code is executed.

For example, if your Rails application is configured to use the "Eastern Time (US & Canada)" time zone (EST/EDT), then `Time.current` will return the current time in that time zone, while `Time.now` would return the time in the server's local time zone.

In summary, use `Time.current` in Rails applications to ensure consistent time zone handling across different environments and avoid surprises related to time zone differences.


======
If we are running the local application in India, then the server's local date and time will be set to India Standard Time (IST) because I'm in India. If you use Time.now, it will return the local time in India. However, if you use Time.current, it will return the current time in the application's configured time zone, which could be UTC or any other time zone set within the application.

` config.time_zone = 'Eastern Time (US & Canada)' `
