**Q1: What is Active Job in Rails?**

**Answer**: Active Job is a framework in Ruby on Rails for handling and processing background jobs. It provides a unified and consistent interface to work with various job queue systems, such as Sidekiq, Delayed Job, Resque, and more. With Active Job, you can write background job code that is independent of the specific job processing system, making it easier to switch between different adapters or queue systems as needed.

**Q2: Why should we use Sidekiq as an external adapter?**

**Answer**: Sidekiq is a popular external adapter for Active Job due to its high performance and feature set. Here's why you might choose Sidekiq:

- **Performance**: Sidekiq is known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for applications with high job processing demands.

- **Advanced Features**: Sidekiq offers features like job retries, scheduled jobs, and extensive monitoring capabilities, which can be valuable for complex applications.

- **Scalability**: Sidekiq is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to handle large workloads by adding more worker processes.

- **Community Support**: Sidekiq has an active community and a wide range of plugins and extensions, making it easier to find solutions to common problems.

**Q3: Why do we need an external adapter for Active Job?**

**Answer**: While Active Job provides a consistent interface for background job processing, it doesn't include a built-in job processing system. Therefore, external adapters like Sidekiq, Delayed Job, or Resque are needed to handle the actual execution of background jobs. These external adapters integrate with specific job queue systems (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) and provide the necessary infrastructure to enqueue, process, and manage jobs efficiently. Using external adapters allows you to choose the best-suited job processing system for your application's requirements and easily switch between them if needed.

**Q4: Basic steps to use Sidekiq as an adapter**

**Answer**: To use Sidekiq as an adapter for Active Job, follow these basic steps:

1. Install the Sidekiq gem in your Rails application by adding it to your Gemfile and running `bundle install`.

2. Configure Sidekiq by creating a Sidekiq configuration file (e.g., `config/sidekiq.yml`) and defining your queues and options.

3. Set the Active Job queue adapter to Sidekiq in your Rails application configuration, typically in `config/application.rb`.

   ```ruby
   config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
   ```

4. Start Sidekiq worker processes using the `bundle exec sidekiq` command to process enqueued jobs.

These steps will allow you to use Sidekiq as an adapter for Active Job and take advantage of its performance and features for background job processing.
