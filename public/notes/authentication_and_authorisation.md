# Authentication vs Authorization

`Authentication` establishes the identity of a user or system through credentials or tokens.
`Authorization` determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on their role, permissions, or other criteria.


# To illustrate the difference, consider a scenario where a user wants to access a certain page on a website:

Authentication: The user provides their username and password to prove their identity.

Authorization: Once the user is authenticated, the system checks if the user's role allows access to the requested page. If the user has the required permissions (authorization), they can view the page; otherwise, they are denied access.
