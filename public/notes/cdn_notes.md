# CDN 
A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a system of distributed servers that work together to deliver web content, including images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, and more, to users based on their geographical location. The primary purpose of a CDN is to improve the speed, performance, and availability of web content by reducing the physical distance between the user and the server hosting the content.

# Google cloud storage

Google Cloud Storage is not a CDN itself, but it's a cloud-based object storage service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It allows you to store and manage various types of data, including images, videos, and other files. However, Google Cloud Storage can be integrated with a CDN to enhance content delivery.

Google Cloud CDN is Google's content delivery service that works with Google Cloud Storage and other Google Cloud services. It's designed to provide low-latency and high-performance content delivery by using Google's globally distributed edge points of presence. When you use Google Cloud CDN in conjunction with Google Cloud Storage, your static content (like images) stored in Google Cloud Storage can be cached and served from the CDN's edge locations, reducing the time it takes for users to access your content.

In your Rails application, you might use CarrierWave to manage file uploads, and Google Cloud Storage to store those uploaded files. If you want to optimize the delivery of those images, you can integrate Google Cloud CDN with your Google Cloud Storage bucket, allowing the CDN to cache and distribute the images to users more efficiently. This would help improve the speed and reliability of image delivery to users across different regions.
