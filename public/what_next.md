I'm glad to hear that you're making progress in your learning project! Since you've already implemented user registration, login, logout, and JWT authentication, here are a few more features and concepts you could consider exploring to enhance your learning:

1. **User Profile and Update Endpoint**:
   Implement an endpoint that allows users to update their profile information. This could include fields like name, email, profile picture, and more.

2. **Password Reset Functionality**:
   Create a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their passwords via email. This involves sending password reset emails with unique tokens and handling the password update process.

3. **Authorization and Roles**:
   Learn about role-based authorization, where different user roles (admin, user) have different levels of access to resources. You can implement different authorization levels for certain endpoints.

4. **Validation and Error Handling**:
   Dive deeper into validation techniques and error handling. Implement custom validators and ensure your API returns meaningful error responses to clients.

5. **Pagination and Sorting**:
   Implement pagination and sorting for endpoints that might return a large number of results. This helps improve the performance and user experience of your API.

6. **File Uploads**:
   Learn how to handle file uploads, such as profile pictures or attachments. You can use gems like `carrierwave` or `active_storage` for this.

7. **Caching**:
   Explore caching strategies to improve the performance of frequently accessed endpoints. Rails provides mechanisms for both server-side and client-side caching.

8. **Testing and Test Automation**:
   Practice writing tests for your API endpoints using tools like RSpec or MiniTest. You can also explore test automation tools like Postman or Newman for API testing.

9. **Documentation**:
   Consider adding API documentation using tools like Swagger or creating detailed README files for your API endpoints.

10. **Webhooks**:
    Implement a webhook endpoint to receive notifications from external services. This is commonly used for integrations and real-time updates.

11. **Rate Limiting and Security**:
    Learn about rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API. Also, explore security practices like input validation, SQL injection prevention, and cross-site scripting (XSS) protection.

12. **Deploy to a Server**:
    Deploy your project to a web server or cloud platform like Heroku or AWS to make it accessible online.

Remember that the best way to learn is by building and experimenting. Choose features that interest you or align with your project's goals, and don't hesitate to explore further areas of Rails and API development that intrigue you. Enjoy your learning journey!
